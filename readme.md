A small mblock extension for the groove RGB failed
==================================================

This is a small mblock extention to enable the groove RGB LCD in mblock, made to support our actitivites in [CoderDojo Belgium](https://www.coderdojobelgium.be/).

This extension contains blocks to show text on the LCD, to set the color of the LCD and clear the screen.
Always be sure to add the use *"use LCD"* block as the first block to initiate the LCD screen.

Installation: in mblock extention manager, search for groove lcd.

The extension contains dutch translations. I welcome pull requests with other translations.

To build the extension for local development:
```
zip -r Grove-LCD-Arduino-Only.zip . -x *.git*
```
